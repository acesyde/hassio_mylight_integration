# mylight150 Home Assistant Integration Project

## Project Goal
This project is a **Home Assistant custom integration** for tracking solar production and energy consumption from [mylight150](https://www.mylight150.com/) products and services.

## About mylight150
mylight150 is a French energy company that provides:
- **Solar panels**: Photovoltaic panels for energy production
- **Virtual battery storage**: MySmartBattery and MyBattery solutions for storing excess solar energy
- **Smart energy management**: MySmartPilot for controlling energy-intensive appliances
- **Energy monitoring**: Real-time consumption and production tracking via mobile applications
- **Energy supplier services**: Acting as both equipment provider and energy supplier

Over 20,000 households are equipped with mylight150 solutions, with customers achieving significant energy bill reductions through intelligent energy management.

## Technical Architecture
The integration uses a **self-developed Python API client library** to communicate with mylight150's services:
- **API Client**: [python-mylight-systems-api-client](https://github.com/acesyde/python-mylight-systems-api-client/blob/main/docs/index.md)
- **Integration Structure**: Located in [custom_components/mylight_systems/](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/)

## Key Integration Components
- [__init__.py](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/__init__.py): Integration setup and platform loading
- [config_flow.py](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/config_flow.py): Configuration flow for user setup
- [coordinator.py](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/coordinator.py): Data coordinator for API communication
- [sensor.py](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/sensor.py): Sensor entities for energy metrics
- [entity.py](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/entity.py): Base entity classes
- [const.py](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/const.py): Constants and configuration

## Supported Languages
The integration includes translations for:
- English ([en.json](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/translations/en.json))
- French ([fr.json](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/translations/fr.json))
- Portuguese ([pt.json](mdc:custom_components/mylight_systems/translations/pt.json))

## Development Environment
- Uses [mise](mdc:mise.toml) for tool management
- Development Home Assistant instance in [hassio_dev/](mdc:hassio_dev/)
- Automated tasks for linting, testing, and development workflow in [tasks/](mdc:tasks/)

## Purpose
Enable Home Assistant users with mylight150 installations to monitor their solar production, energy consumption, battery storage levels, and overall energy management directly within their Home Assistant dashboard.
